# Proyect: <span style="color:#e6538a">2048 - Blocks</span>
*Lógica para Cs. de la Computación - 2025*

## Roadmap

- Always load hints using animation times and cache the shoot info so as to use said info when the user finally shoots.



# In process

### Shoot cache system

Init shoots and caches all possible outcomes at start.
The back end seems to work but I still have to check for correctness.
The front end is yet to use the cached info.

## Know bugs

- Addind 2 new blocks to the shoot range in quick succession leads to the pop up block changing mid notification.
